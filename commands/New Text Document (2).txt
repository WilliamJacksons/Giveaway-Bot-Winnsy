Dear Wise Support Team,

I am reaching out regarding a transaction that appears to have been duplicated. Below are the complete details for your review:

Date of Transaction: 10 November 2025 at 14:37

Transaction Amount: €1.53 EUR

Item Purchased: Discord Nitro – 3 Month TRIAL Subscription Key GLOBAL

Payment Method: Card ending in 4272, processed via PayPal account mailusa20000@gmail.com

I have already contacted the merchant through their website on the same day (10 November 2025). Their support agent, Just Charles, responded with the following message:

"Hello,
Just Charles here.

I understand that you're seeing a duplicate transaction in your payment method and would like to sort things out.

I've carefully checked your order on our end and found that it was only one transaction on our side. It could've been duplicated due to a technical issue on your payment provider's side, but usually those transactions get reverted after some time.

Please try checking it back after 24 hours and see if it's reverted. If not, I recommend reaching out to Wise directly for further assistance, since on our side it's only a single transaction.

Thank you for understanding.

Regards,
Just Charles"

The merchant confirmed that only a single transaction was processed on their end and suggested I contact Wise for further investigation.

A screenshot of my correspondence with the merchant has been attached, showing the full conversation and their official response.

Please review this case and assist in resolving the duplicate transaction issue.

Thank you for your time and support.

Kind regards,
Oussama Hemissi
